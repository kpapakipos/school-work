Step 3: I got a segmentation fault.

Step 4: 3000: Output was "Before forking." followed by what appeared to be interleaved printouts by the parent and child processes from 0 to 99. Some of the printouts were out of order- for instance, the child process printed two in a row instead of having a parent print between them.
500: The same content was printed, but faster. I got more failures of interleaving- 3 in a row.
5000: Slower than 3000. Again, 2 printouts in a row from child.
