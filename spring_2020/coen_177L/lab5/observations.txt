// Title: Lab5 â€“ synchronization
// Description: This file is a compilation of my notes and answers to questions for the lab.

1) Note: threadSync.c didn't tell me how to run it, and I had to add an include statement for it to compile.
It printed out greetings from each thread, with a longer delay between each print because of the 1 second sleep.
Then a message from each thread saying it returned. One pattern I noticed was the returns were always in order, 0-9. This is different from the last lab's version, where the order was usually jumbled.
