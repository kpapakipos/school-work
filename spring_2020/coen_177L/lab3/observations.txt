Threads can print out the same values of i because the go function takes in a memory location- so that location could be updated, or not, before the print statement inside go. This is a race condition.

Step 7: The fix I used was making an array containing the values 0-9, then passing references to the appropriate array locations. These memory locations don't change, so different threads will always have the correct i values.
